# Pikuma - Mystic Woods

Follow along project with Pikuma's 2D Game Engine with C++ and Lua. This project serves as an introduction to Data-Oriented Design (DOD) principles, well teaching me
basic game engine design as well.

# A few differences
- I am using SDL3 instead of SDL2 as used by the original course
- Replacing using provided game assets with my own, sourced from itch.io
